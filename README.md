Required Steps to Run SSVEP-Toolbox Codes

**Step 1: Download and Unzip the Codes**
- Download the SSVEP-Toolbox codes.
-  Unzip the downloaded files.

**Step 2: Download Benchmark Dataset**
- Download the Benchmark dataset (https://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html). 
- Place the dataset in a folder as shown in Pictures 1,2.

**Step 3 (Optional): Additional Code for tensor-based Methods**

If you want to run MCCA, MsetCCA, or Multiway CCA, you need to:
- Download the tensor_toolbox-master (https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox/-/tree/dev). 
- Add the Tensor Toolbox to the toolbox folder along with the functions folder as shown in Picture 3.

**Step 4: Add SSVEP-Toolbox to MATLAB Path**
- Run the Installation Script **"install.m"** in MATLAB.

**Step 5: Run Demo Codes**
- Run the demo codes of each algorithm for SSVEP frequency detection.
